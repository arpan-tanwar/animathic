# Manim Service Optimization Report

## Overview

Completely rewrote the Manim video generation service to eliminate syntax errors and improve reliability.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Robust AI Prompt Engineering**

- **Issue**: AI was generating code with syntax errors, particularly "unexpected character after line continuation character"
- **Solution**:
  - Created bulletproof prompts with explicit syntax rules
  - Added working code examples as templates
  - Emphasized NO backslashes except in strings
  - Provided clear structure requirements

### 2. **Comprehensive Code Sanitization**

- **Pre-validation cleaning**:
  - Strip markdown code blocks
  - Remove non-ASCII characters
  - Eliminate problematic backslashes outside strings
  - Remove unsupported Manim parameters
- **Structure enforcement**:
  - Ensure proper imports (`from manim import *`)
  - Wrap code in Scene class if missing
  - Maintain proper indentation (4 spaces)

### 3. **Advanced Syntax Validation**

- **Multi-layer validation**:
  - AST parsing for syntax correctness
  - Custom validation for Manim-specific issues
  - Security validation against dangerous patterns
  - Balance checking for brackets/parentheses
- **Detailed error reporting**:
  - Specific line numbers and error types
  - Actionable fix suggestions
  - Error feedback to next generation attempt

### 4. **Intelligent Retry Logic with Error Feedback**

- **Progressive improvement**:
  - Pass previous error details to AI for next attempt
  - Up to 3 attempts with increasingly specific guidance
  - Fallback to guaranteed-working animation if all fail
- **Error categorization**:
  - Syntax errors → code structure fixes
  - Render errors → Manim compatibility fixes
  - Timeout errors → complexity reduction

### 5. **Optimized Model Configuration**

- **AI model settings**:
  - Very low temperature (0.1) for consistent code
  - Adjusted safety thresholds to reduce blocking
  - Streamlined generation config
- **Response extraction**:
  - Multiple fallback methods for text extraction
  - Robust handling of empty/malformed responses

### 6. **Enhanced Security & Performance**

- **Security validator**:
  - Whitelist of allowed Manim objects/functions
  - Block dangerous imports and operations
  - Prevent code injection attempts
- **Resource management**:
  - Memory and CPU limits during rendering
  - Timeout protection (2 minutes max)
  - Automatic cleanup of temporary files

### 7. **Better Error Messages & Debugging**

- **User-friendly errors**:
  - Clear categorization of failure types
  - Specific suggestions for common issues
  - Code preview in successful responses
- **Developer debugging**:
  - Comprehensive logging at each step
  - Preserved error context across attempts
  - Performance timing information

## Technical Implementation

### New Service Architecture

```
OptimizedManimService
├── _build_robust_prompt()          # AI prompt engineering
├── _extract_response_text()        # Response parsing
├── _sanitize_code()                # Code cleaning
├── _validate_syntax_thoroughly()   # Validation
├── generate_animation()            # Main entry point
└── _render_manim_code()           # Manim execution
```

### Key Classes

- `AnimationResult`: Structured result with success/error details
- `SecurityValidator`: Code security and safety validation
- `OptimizedManimService`: Main service with retry logic

### Integration Points

- Updated `main.py` to use new `generate_video_from_prompt()` function
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing API endpoints
- Enhanced error responses with detailed failure information

## Expected Results

### Before (Issues Fixed)

- ❌ "unexpected character after line continuation character" errors
- ❌ Empty responses from AI (finish_reason=2)
- ❌ av.error.ExternalError from unsupported Manim features
- ❌ Fallback animations on first failure
- ❌ No error feedback between attempts

### After (Improvements)

- ✅ Comprehensive syntax validation before execution
- ✅ Intelligent retry with error-specific feedback
- ✅ Sanitized code generation with safety checks
- ✅ Robust response extraction and parsing
- ✅ Optimized AI model settings for code generation
- ✅ Detailed error reporting and debugging information

## Testing

- Created `test_manim_service.py` for validation
- Syntax validation tests pass
- Ready for deployment with improved reliability

## Deployment Notes

- Requires `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` environment variable
- All dependencies maintained (fastapi, manim, google-generativeai)
- Enhanced error handling prevents service crashes
- Automatic cleanup prevents disk space issues

This rewrite addresses all identified issues while maintaining full API compatibility and significantly improving the user experience.
